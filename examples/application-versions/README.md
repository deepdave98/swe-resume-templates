# One source, three application versions

Keep your facts in one place. Choose which bullets to show for backend, frontend, or infrastructure applications. Changing a shared date, contact, or bullet updates every version that uses it when you recompile.

This is an optional example. The regular templates still work as before. No generator, new file format, or extra LaTeX package.

## Start

[Open in Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdeepdave98%2Fswe-resume-templates%2Fmain%2Fdownloads%2Fapplication-versions.zip&engine=xelatex&main_document=backend.tex) or [download the ZIP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepdave98/swe-resume-templates/main/downloads/application-versions.zip).

The ZIP contains all three versions and their shared files. Keep them in one project; three separate Overleaf projects would stop sharing edits.

In Overleaf, go to **Settings > Compiler > Main document** and choose `backend.tex`, `frontend.tex`, or `infrastructure.tex`. The import starts with `backend.tex` and XeLaTeX. Recompile after changing the selection. When editing a shared file, Overleaf builds the selected main document. [Main document settings](https://docs.overleaf.com/getting-started/recompiling-your-project/the-main-document)

Locally, run this inside the extracted ZIP or `examples/application-versions/`:

```bash
latexmk -outdir=build backend.tex frontend.tex infrastructure.tex
```

The included `latexmkrc` selects XeLaTeX. The PDFs are `build/backend.pdf`, `build/frontend.pdf`, and `build/infrastructure.pdf`. To build only one, pass only that file. This command also works on Windows with `latexmk` on `PATH`.

From the repository root, `make application-versions` writes the PDFs to `build/application-versions/`.

## Edit facts once

| File | Edit here |
| --- | --- |
| `content/profile.tex` | Name, city, contacts, and profile links |
| `content/experience.tex` | Titles, employers, dates, and the full set of work bullets |
| `content/education.tex` | Education |
| `content/skills.tex` | Skills |
| `backend.tex`, `frontend.tex`, `infrastructure.tex` | Bullet selection and order for each application |
| `setup.tex` | Shared imports and the one-page warning |
| `resume.cls` | Styling; supplied in the ZIP, reused from the root in a clone |

Replace every example with your own facts. Do not change your title or employer to match a job posting. Select work that is relevant and that you can explain.

## Select bullets

Each named command in `content/experience.tex` holds one bullet. The version files list the commands to include inside `jobduties`. Remove a command to omit a bullet; move it to change the order. The text stays in the shared file.

To add a bullet, define it once in `content/experience.tex`:

```latex
\newcommand{\BulletExportRecovery}{%
  \ResumeBullet{Fixed [export failure] by [change]; verified [recovery behavior] with [test].}%
}
```

Then select it inside the relevant role's `jobduties` list:

```latex
\BulletExportRecovery
```

Use a unique command name containing letters only. Keep `\ResumeBullet{...}` around the text: it adds the list item and checks that selected bullet for placeholders. Do not add another `\item` before it. An unknown command is a compile error, not an omitted bullet.

To add a role, copy one shared role command and define it under a new name. Add that command and its selected bullet list to each version where the role belongs. Keep entries in reverse chronological order. The versions choose content explicitly; new roles and bullets are not included automatically.

## Check before sending

Rebuild every version you plan to send. Editing a shared file does not update a PDF you already downloaded.

- Read each PDF, including contacts, dates, links, and page breaks.
- Check the compile log for placeholders and the one-page limit.
- Unselected bullets are not checked. Review them when you select them later. Text hidden inside your own commands may also escape the checks.
- Only a PDF contains the selected version. The source ZIP contains the entire bullet bank, including unselected material. Do not send it with an application or post private work in a public fork.

The versions are different selections of the same history, not three different histories. These checks do not judge your claims or score your resume.
