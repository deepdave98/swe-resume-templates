# Engineering Resume Bullet Examples

Show what you changed and how you checked it. The reader should not have to guess your part of the work.

Use these as prompts, not claims. Replace every square-bracketed placeholder inside an example bullet with a fact you can defend, then delete anything that is not yours.

- Name your contribution, not the team's.
- Give a baseline, unit, and scope when they matter.
- Label benchmarks and load tests; do not present them as production results.
- No useful number? Name what shipped, passed, reconciled, or was adopted.
- Mention a tool only when it explains the solution.

For early-career roles, describe the part you built or fixed. For experienced roles, include decisions and rollout responsibilities, not just a larger number.

Applying for AI or ML work? See the [AI and ML starters and bullet prompts](../docs/ai-ml-resumes.md).

To paste an example into a `.tex` file, add `\item` and [escape LaTeX's special characters](../README.md#edit-the-content).

## Backend Engineering

### Early-Career Backend

- Built `[API operation]` for `[user workflow]` with `[framework and database]`, validated `[input or authorization rule]`, and tested `[success and failure cases]`.
- Profiled `[endpoint or query]` against `[dataset]` and added `[index, batching, or cache]`, reducing benchmark p95 latency from `[A] ms` to `[B] ms` at `[load]`.
- Implemented `[background task]` with bounded retries and `[idempotency control]`, then replayed `[failed event or request]` without losing or applying work twice.
- Reproduced `[failure]`, fixed `[underlying defect]`, and added a regression test that failed before the fix.

### Experienced Backend

- Migrated `[service, API, or schema]` with `[rollout method]`, moving `[N clients or records]` with `[downtime result]`; `[reconciliation check]` confirmed `[result]`.
- Made `[workflow]` safe to retry with `[idempotency key or replay-safe write]`; tested duplicate delivery and a timeout after commit.
- Removed `[database, lock, network, or serialization]` bottleneck, reducing production p99 latency from `[A] ms` to `[B] ms` at `[comparable load]`.
- Defined `[shared API contract]` with `[consumer teams]`; migrated `[integrations]` while preserving `[required behavior]` for old clients.

## Frontend Engineering

### Early-Career Frontend

- Built the loading, empty, error, and retry states for `[workflow]`, handled `[stale response or duplicate submission]` with `[control]`, and tested `[failure case]`.
- Implemented `[workflow]` with semantic HTML; verified keyboard operation, focus order, accessible names, and error announcements with `[screen reader and browser]`.
- Profiled `[page]` under `[device and network conditions]` and changed `[image delivery, critical CSS, code splitting, or render path]`, reducing lab LCP from `[A] s` to `[B] s`.
- Built `[workflow]` across `[breakpoints and browsers]`; fixed `[layout failure]` and added a visual regression test at the affected width.

### Experienced Frontend

- Used real-user monitoring to find `[long task, render cascade, or synchronous handler]`, removed it with `[change]`, and improved p75 INP from `[A] ms` to `[B] ms` for `[traffic segment]` over `[time window]`.
- Migrated `[screens]` to `[shared component system]`; preserved `[keyboard or screen-reader behavior]` and tested old and new versions before rollout.
- Fixed `[stale response or cache invalidation defect]` in `[workflow]` with `[change]`; tested rapid navigation and out-of-order responses.
- Instrumented `[user journey]` and shipped `[change]`; a controlled experiment moved `[completion, conversion, or error rate]` from `[A]` to `[B]` across `[sample and time window]`.

## Data Engineering

### Early-Career Data

- Built a scheduled `[Python or SQL]` pipeline from `[source]` to `[consumer]`, documented `[data assumptions]`, and tested missing, duplicate, and malformed records before each refresh.
- Modeled `[domain]` into `[table design]`; added uniqueness and freshness checks that stopped invalid refreshes before `[consumer]` updated.
- Backfilled `[dataset and date range]` with checkpoints, reconciled row counts and aggregates against `[source of truth]`, and wrote `[N]` records without duplicates.
- Changed `[partitioning, filter placement, join strategy, or materialization]` after reading `[query plan]`, reducing runtime from `[A]` to `[B]` on `[data volume]`.

### Experienced Data

- Migrated `[warehouse or lake workload]` with dual runs and checkpointed backfills, moving `[N]` tables and `[N] TB` while meeting `[SLA]`; `[row-count or aggregate check]` confirmed `[result]`.
- Added `[freshness or correctness]` checks to `[pipelines]`; routed alerts to the owning team and tested recovery from `[upstream failure]`.
- Changed `[partitioning or materialization]` for `[workload]`, reducing p95 query time from `[A] s` to `[B] s` on `[comparable data volume]`.
- Chose `[batch, micro-batch, or streaming]` for `[use case]` after measuring `[freshness need]`; met `[SLO]` without `[cost or operating burden of the main alternative]`.

## Weak vs. Defensible

| Weak | Defensible |
| --- | --- |
| Improved scalability by 40%. | Split `[workflow]` at `[service boundary]`, migrated `[traffic share]` with `[rollout method]`, and reduced production p99 latency from `[A] ms` to `[B] ms` at `[peak load]`. |
| Built responsive React components. | Built `[workflow]` across `[breakpoints and browsers]`, verified `[keyboard or screen-reader behavior]`, and added visual regression tests for `[N]` components. |
| Developed ETL pipelines with Python and Spark. | Built a daily pipeline from `[source]` to `[consumer]` with replay-safe writes and `[quality checks]`, processing `[N]` records within `[freshness window]`. |

Before keeping a bullet, ask whether you would describe the work that way to the person who reviewed it. If you include a measurement, be ready to explain it.
