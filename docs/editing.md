# Editing reference

Edit `resume.tex` in a starter ZIP or `templates/*-resume.tex` in a clone. Shared styling lives in `resume.cls`.

## Contacts

Keep these inside `\resumecontact`; each value supplies both the printed text and link:

```latex
\resumephone{+1 (416) 555-0123}
\resumeemail{alex_morgan+jobs@example.com}
```

Use a literal email address; underscores, plus signs, and hyphens work. Phone numbers need `+`, a country code, and 7–15 digits total. Spaces, parentheses, hyphens, and periods stay visible but are removed from the link. No country code is guessed.

Unsupported formats warn and print without a link. Use `\resumelink{destination}{label}` for extensions, custom email syntax, or different labels; check both values. Remove a contact with its preceding `\contactsep`.

## Entries

```latex
\jobentry[Optional summary]{Role}{Organization}{Location}{Dates}
\begin{jobduties}
  \item Fixed [failure] in [workflow] by [change]; added a regression test for [trigger].
\end{jobduties}
```

Omit `[Optional summary]` when unnecessary. Use `{}` for no location. Long organizations and locations wrap beside the dates. Keep dates short and use labels instead of long URLs; unbroken text can overflow.

Escape special characters in literal text: `\&`, `\%`, `\$`, `\#`, `\_`.

Move whole `\section{...}` blocks to change the order. If shortening the experienced starter to one page, remove `\newpage` and `\section{Experience Continued}`. [Section order guide](section-order.md).

## Paper size

Use `\documentclass[a4paper]{resume}` for A4 or `\documentclass[letterpaper]{resume}` for US Letter. Recompile and inspect every page; changing paper size can change line and page breaks.

## Compile warnings

Open **View logs** in Overleaf (**Logs and output files** in the older editor), or read the local compile log.

- **Placeholders:** flags sample contacts, known example fields, and `[prompts]` in headers, entries, and lists. Replace flagged text or delete unused entries. Literal square brackets may be flagged; unmarked examples and text inside custom commands may be missed.
- **Page limit:** `\resumepagelimit{1}` warns above one page; the experienced starter uses `2`. Cut less relevant content first. Change the number for an intentional extra page, or remove the command to disable it.

Neither warning changes the PDF or stops compilation. Resolve rerun warnings before checking length; temporary rerun pages are not counted by the reminder. Review the final text, layout, and links yourself.
